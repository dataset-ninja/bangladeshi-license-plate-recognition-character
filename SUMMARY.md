**Bangladeshi License Plate Recognition: Character Recognition** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the surveillance industry. 

The dataset consists of 4061 images with 35705 labeled objects belonging to 27 different classes including *metro*, *dhaka*, *1*, and other: *2*, *0*, *ga*, *3*, *4*, *5*, *9*, *7*, *8*, *6*, *ta*, *khulna*, *ba*, *ja*, *gha*, *kha*, *jashore*, *chattogram*, *ha*, *ca*, *da*, *ka*, *va*, and *na*.

Images in the Bangladeshi License Plate Recognition: Character Recognition dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (3480 images), *validation* (363 images), and *test* (218 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh</span>.
